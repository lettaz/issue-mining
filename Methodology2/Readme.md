# Analysis

Analyzing the types of labels frequently associated with issues labeled as "features" and understand their contribution to defining the concept of a feature, I would be using this characteristics from our dataset;

# Process

1) Execute the code in the file **Checking_issues_label_feature.ipynb** to fetch all the issues that has a label 'feature' from the already gotten **seed_dataset.csv**, and the result of the analysis are stored in **main_dataset.csv**
This analysis also gets the labels associated with 'feature'

2) Execute the code in the file **Checking_associate_frequency.ipynb** to get the frequency of the issue labels that are associated with 'feature' and the result is saved in **label_associate_count.csv**
