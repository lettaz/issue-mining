# An Exploratory Study on what defines a feature from issue label as feature and their characteristics

This is a step by step guide to recreate the dataset and experiments that we performed for this paper.

# Setting up the Anaconda Environment

1) `conda env create --file environment.yml`

2) `conda activate plot`

3) `jupyter notebook`

## Seed data analysis

We got our preliminary dataset (result.csv) which already had data on repositories with labels named feature from SEART using the GUI https://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch/

### Steps to reproduce our seed data

1) Execute the code in the file **seed_data_analysis.ipynb** to fetch all the repos with label named feature and having more than 500 stars with totalIssues greater than 20.
