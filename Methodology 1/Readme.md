# Analysis

Analyzing the average time to close issues labelled as "feature" and comparing the lifecycle characteristics of feature-labelled issues with other issues can provide valuable insights into the behavioural patterns and characteristics of feature-related issues.

# Process:

The methodology was broken into three stages

1) Execute the code in the file **Main_Analysis.ipynb** to fetch all the issues that are closed with their characteristics needed for analysis.

2) Execute the code in the file **Ordered_Analysis** to get the average completion time and order the data in a descending order based on the completion time.

3) Execute the code in the file **Repositpory_Similarity_check** to get the first three and last three repositories based on the issues completion time and compare the similarities.

## Visualisation
